This application was created to replicate the supervised learning ID3 algorithm detailed in the classic paper Induction of Decision Trees. The main feature of the decision tree is that it is able to process past data sets using entropy calculations to make judgments about the qualities of incoming unknown data sets. For example, one possible application of a decision tree is to determine whether or not a part of an image is land or forest. It is then ideal to have an application that given any image of a surface area will be able to determine if it is land or forest. The decision tree can serve as this application after being trained on a training set of images of lands and forests. After viewing enough images, it'll be able to ascertain if a certain collection of pixels with a certain intensity will be land or image based off what it has seen in the past.

This version of the algorithm is a simplified version that processes data sets of descriptions rather than images.

Currently, the algorithm works as intended for the small, sample test set. To overcome memory errors with working with 7 million instances in the large data set, a hash table was implemented to work around this obstacle. Optimizations still need to be made to enable efficient processing after loading in this large data set.
